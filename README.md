## VowelFinder Project

I created a function called "vowelFinder"
I first created an empty array.
I also stored all the vowels in an array called "vowels" including the capital version of each letter.
Using a for loop I then an if condition, I looped through my word and i compared it to the letters in the vowels array.
After comparing, I pushed the index of each letter whoose comparison proved true into the empty array I created.
I then increased each element in the array by 1.
Then I consoled the array of the numbers
